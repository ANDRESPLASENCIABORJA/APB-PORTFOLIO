# APB-PORTFOLIO

## Head
In the head section after creating the meta charset of the document I linked all the css files to my html as you can see there are two of them, the reset.css to quit the design from the webpage an the style.css to add my own design to it, also there is the link to foundation library that was the one that I used to make the webpage responsive and for designing it instead of bootstrap so it looks more original.

## CSS
For the design I chosed the canva color pallette: https://www.canva.com/colors/color-palettes/denim-clad-shutterbug/ so the user can interact with a friendly nice webpage.

## Header
For this project first I developed a header with a short hand introduce to myself and with a nav bar in it so the employees can navigate to all the sections of my portfolio webpage, which are the first one "about", second "portfolio", and the last one the "contact" section on the footer for the design i used also a bacground image located on the css file and for all the document hover attributes to the links so the user can know what is doing.

## Main sections

## Main section number 1
In this section with the class of .about-section the user will be able to see an image of mine and a short description of who i am and which are my attributes with progress bars.

## Main section number 2
On this second section the user will be able to see an go to my work through a short description of the proyect and a link to the live url webpage inside of every image of the section, there are 3 of my developements, one is the project 1, and the otherones homeworks from the bootcamp, although is important for me to mention that i did not found a good design way to place the links for all my repos so at the footer there is the link for my collaborative repository proyect 1 and also the link to my GITHUB profile so the user can see my code right there.

## Footer
Finaly here it is my contact information with links to it so the user can go to mi Linkedin profile, to my GITHUB repositories and have my phone numer an email to contact me.
